  description: Doing ray tracing with matrix multiplication
---

If you're tracing rays or transforming coordinates, you could be using PDL!

A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.
Having seen how to do matrix multiplication [on 16 December](/advent/blog/2024/12/16/matrix-mult/),
the Elf R&D department, headed by Rudolf and [Dancer](https://www.dancer.pm/),
decided to calculate the sparkle from their baubles.
In optics, tracing light rays through bits of glass that act as mirrors and lenses
can be done by working through a series of equations _or_ by
[multiplying matrices and vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_transfer_matrix_analysis)!

If a ray at height _y_ and angle _Î¸_, travels a distance _d_, where does it end up?
Using vector multiplication with this matrix,

![Transfer matrix for free space](transfer_matrix.png)
gives you a resultant vector like this

![vector transformed by the  matrix](vector_transform.png)

What happens when the ray hits a thin lens, focal length **_f_**?

Nice, but what's the big deal?

Well, these things stack. The end of one light ray path is the beginning of the next.
You follow the path from element to element until you get to the end of your optical system.
Even better, the calculation in PDL is in the same order as the written mathematics;
start with the vector on the right and work through the elements in the path from right to left in the code.

What's that, Blitzen? How does that look in PDL?

Well, given values for the distances `$d0 .. $d4`, and focal lengths `$f1 .. $f4`

    $ab = [1,0]    # shortcuts for defining elements
    $cd = [0,1]

    $T0 = pdl([1, $d0], $cd)
    $L1 = pdl($ab,      [-1/$f1, 1])
    $T1 = pdl([1, $d1], $cd)
    $L2 = pdl($ab,      [-1/$f2, 1])
    $T2 = pdl([1, $d2], $cd)
    $L3 = pdl($ab,      [-1/$f3, 1])
    $T3 = pdl([1, $d3], $cd)
    $L4 = pdl($ab,      [-1/$f4, 1])
    $T4 = pdl([1, $d4], $cd)

    $y_theta0 = pdl($y0, $th0)
    $y_theta9 = $T4 x $L4 x $T3 x $L3 x $T2 x $L2 x $T1 x $L1 x $T0 x $y_theta0

The only calculation is that one last line. The rest are all defining the system.

This makes it easy to add elements and even compute a single Ray Transfer Matrix for the whole system.
It will be faster than Perl when it comes to iterating over a million vectors.
Being PDL, there's nothing stopping you from constructing a `$y_theta0` ndarray with _all_ your vectors
and computing the set of transformed vectors in a single line of code. (I haven't tested that yet)

This, of course, is the _Ideal Situation_. Back in Reality, the elves will need to check that
light rays don't go outside the diameter of the lenses in the middle of the system.
Santa is very rooted in the Real World and takes a dim view of _unphysical results_.

We're not limited to these two basic matrices.
Here are four more formulae for optical elements which show mirrors as well as a lens with a changing index of refraction.

And Wikipedia also
[has prisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_transfer_matrix_analysis#Matrices_for_simple_optical_components).

There already is a Perl module that adds optical elements for you called
[Physics::RayTransfer](https://metacpan.org/pod/Physics::RayTransfer) (Hi, Joel! _also author of [PDL::Util](https://metacpan.org/pod/PDL::Util)_ ).
It has a nice Object Oriented interface, but it doesn't use PDL,
so if you've got a script that runs for a long time maybe adding PDL ndarrays to the attributes
will give you that speed up you're looking for.

Wow, Rudolph!
Calculating refractions hasn't been this much fun [since 1021 CE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Optics)!
