# This is the site configuration file. The format is YAML, and the config is
# read by Beam::Wire, a dependency-injection library that builds complete
# objects. For full details on how to edit this file, see
# Statocles::Help::Config.
#
# This file contains configuration for objects. Each object has a name, like
# "site", "theme", or "blog_app". This name can be used to refer to the object
# later, for example, using "$ref: name".
#
# Every object has a "class". Developers can customize behavior by changing the
# class or creating their own classes. If you need help with an object, look at
# the class's documentation.
#
# Every object has "args", which are the object's attributes. See the class's
# documentation for a full list of attributes and what they do.
#
# Many objects have events. Event handlers can be configured using the "on"
# key. See the class's documentation for a list of possible events. Every
# event handler should have at least "$class" and a "$sub". "$class" is the
# plugin class. "$sub" is the plugin method to run. If necessary, you can
# add "$args" to configure the plugin object.

# site: This is the main site object. Site objects handle building and
# deploying, and store global site data like themes and navigation. See
# Statocles::Site for a full list of attributes and what they do.
site:
    $class: 'Statocles::Site'

    # title: This is the title of the site, shown in the <title> tag
    title: 'PDL Advent calendar 2024'

    # base_url: This is the base URL the site will be deployed to. It
    # should be a full URL, and may contain a path, like:
    #
    #   http://example.com/username
    #
    # If the base_url contains a path, all internal links will be
    # rewritten appropriately.
    base_url: 'https://pdl.perl.org/advent/'

    # apps: These are the applications in this site. The name of the app,
    # "blog", "page", or "static", is used to refer to it in commands.

    #
    # The "main" nav is the primary navigation for the site. Every theme
    # should have this one.
    #
    # Each nav consists of an array of links. See the Statocles::Link class
    # for a list of attributes and what they mean. The most important are
    # "text", the text of the link, and "href", the URL to link to.

                  Harald Jörg never got paid to write Perl software.
                  He wrote software in several programming languages,
                  and occasionally he did get paid to solve problems quickly.
                  Perl is his language of choice for these things.
