# This is the site configuration file. The format is YAML, and the config is
# read by Beam::Wire, a dependency-injection library that builds complete
# objects. For full details on how to edit this file, see
# Statocles::Help::Config.
#
# This file contains configuration for objects. Each object has a name, like
# "site", "theme", or "blog_app". This name can be used to refer to the object
# later, for example, using "$ref: name".
#
# Every object has a "class". Developers can customize behavior by changing the
# class or creating their own classes. If you need help with an object, look at
# the class's documentation.
#
# Every object has "args", which are the object's attributes. See the class's
# documentation for a full list of attributes and what they do.
#
# Many objects have events. Event handlers can be configured using the "on"
# key. See the class's documentation for a list of possible events. Every
# event handler should have at least "$class" and a "$sub". "$class" is the
# plugin class. "$sub" is the plugin method to run. If necessary, you can
# add "$args" to configure the plugin object.

# site: This is the main site object. Site objects handle building and
# deploying, and store global site data like themes and navigation. See
# Statocles::Site for a full list of attributes and what they do.
site:
    $class: 'Statocles::Site'

    # title: This is the title of the site, shown in the <title> tag
    title: 'PDL Advent calendar 2024'

    # base_url: This is the base URL the site will be deployed to. It
    # should be a full URL, and may contain a path, like:
    #
    #   http://example.com/username
    #
    # If the base_url contains a path, all internal links will be
    # rewritten appropriately.
    base_url: 'https://pdl.perl.org'

    # apps: These are the applications in this site. The name of the app,
    # "blog", "page", or "static", is used to refer to it in commands.
    apps:

        # blog: This is the blog app
        blog:

    # Navigations are used to move between applications, or to go to
    # specific, important pages.
    #
    # The "main" nav is the primary navigation for the site. Every theme
    # should have this one.
    #
    # Each nav consists of an array of links. See the Statocles::Link class
    # for a list of attributes and what they mean. The most important are
    # "text", the text of the link, and "href", the URL to link to.
